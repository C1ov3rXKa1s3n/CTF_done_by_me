Description:As per the Nmap report. there are three ports open. When we visit port no 80 it turns out to be a page saying "It works". When we view source code it shows pChart 2.1.3 EXPLOIT NO 1.
It is vulnerable to Directory Tranversal. By using this exploitation we can go on viewing different files on server. One of the files I found it to be interesting is apache.conf EXPLOIT NO. 2.
Which shows only Mozila/4.0 is able to visit on port 8080. So we changed the user-agent to Mozila/4.0. Now we can visit port 8080. It is phptax which is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution EXPLOIT NO 3.
After getting the reverse shell from RCE. We try to escalate the privilege which can be done using EXPLOIT NO 4.Yupp we got Root Shell.
Exploit Worked:
1.https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31173
2.usr/local/etc/apache22/httpd.conf
3.https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/21665
