Description:
	When opening the IP it shows a login page which is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The password field is actually vulnerable.By bypassing the authentication you will come to page where john's password is written.
Which MyNameIsJohn. As SSH is running we will do ssh with this credentials.Yupp it works. After some system information gathering I found out that Robert's password and mysql running on root without password.
Using User Defined Function I was able to get escalated privileges.
select * from mysql.func;
select sys_exec('cp /bin/sh /tmp/; chown root:root /tmp/sh; chmod +s /tmp/sh');



SMB Users:
nobody, root, loneferret, john, robert 

Username and Password Enumeration:
Robert:ADGAdsafdfwt4gadfga==
John: MyNameIsJohn
